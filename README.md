Code and figures used in my 2020 CICOES internship presentation:
Yamane MT, Claret M, Lelong P
"Near-inertial wave interactions with cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in the northwestern Mediterranean"

**EddyTracks** holds functions used in data processing and helper functions for statistics
**eddy_map** animates eddy centers and shapes at a depth of 500m over a map of the Gulf of Lion contoured by Rossby number for the month of July
**eddy_stats** creates histograms for eddy lifetime (days), propagation (km), Rossby number, and max radius (km)
**spectra_area** creates rotary spectra of the open ocean in the Gulf of Lion at the surface, 500m, and 1500m
**spectra_eddies** creates rotary spectra following eddy centers in the Gulf of Lion at the surface, 500m, and 1500m
